# Atmoos.Sphere

A collection of .Net mechanisms to simplify daily work as a .Net developer.

[![master status](https://github.com/atmoos/Sphere/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/atmoos/Sphere/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

Currently this is mostly a collection of patterns that I frequently encountered and which I was able to convert into an easy to use mechanism without introducing any dependencies to other libraries.

As such, this library contains very few abstractions, but many extension methods.

Please see the individual project's readme files for a list of mechanisms and the corresponding test projects on how to best use these mechanisms.

## Focus & Goals

- Wrapping "old-style" patterns into current .Net types.
- Dealing with patterns that are easy to understand but hard to get right when taking all edge cases into account.
- Extensive coverage with high quality tests.
- Improving performance by creating high performance mechanisms for common patterns

Essentially, an attempt to make your life easier by providing performant and rigorously tested mechanisms for commonly occurring patterns.
