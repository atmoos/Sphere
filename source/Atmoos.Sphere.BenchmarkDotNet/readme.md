# Atmoos.Sphere.BenchmarkDotNet

This library can export your benchmark results into the corresponding benchmark source file. This is useful to keep track of the benchmarking results as your own project progresses.

One scenario is to run all benchmarks before a release or major PR. Improvements and regressions will become visible in the diff.

Usage examples can be found in the repo [Atmoos.Sphere.Benchmark](https://github.com/atmoos/Sphere/tree/main/source/Atmoos.Sphere.Benchmark).
